This website was proudly built with HTML + CSS (and two small scripts [^1]).

I had spent months thinking about renovating my blog. Which framework? What theme?

I looked to other portfolios for inspirationâ€”and often left annoyed by constant animations and stock graphics. Just let me read the content! All it needs is a *little* bit of style.

### Driving a Ferrari in a school zone

A Ferrari isn't going to show its true capabilities off-track [^2]. For most use cases, a Corolla is far better pick. It does the exact same thing, takes less energy to run, and is cheap to maintain.

Likewise, you don't *need* frameworks. Featherweight blogs aren't nails you want to hit with those heavy hammers. If you're a dev, you don't need to flex them on your website; [the actual flex is using the right tool for the job](https://clairefro.dev/blog/p/look-ma-no-react-why-i-recoded-my-portfolio-site-with-vanilla-everything#modern-frameworks-are-a-false-flex).

### In 2023...

The internet is bloated, and that's a shame. [These](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) [pages](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) showed me [the](https://brutalist-web.design/) [light](https://bearblog.dev/).

So I wrote this website to be simple, fast, and responsive by default. There are no animations, no fancy menus, and no backends. I'm proud to be using No-SQL for this one.

It's Web 1.0 bliss, and it's oddly refreshing.
