Welcome to my digital collection of books: read, being-read, and to-be-read!

> What is an <a href="https://nesslabs.com/antilibrary">antilibrary</a>?
  Instead of a celebration of everything you know, an antilibrary is an ode
  to everything you want to explore.

I got the idea from <a href="https://jzhao.xyz/books">Jacky Zhao</a>.

### Biographical/Memoir
- *Elon Musk* - Walter Isaacson
- *Bad Blood* - John Carreyrou
- *The Diary of a Young Girl* - Anne Frank
- *Man's Search for Meaning* - Viktor E. Frankl
- [x] *Born a Crime* - Trevor Noah
- [x] *I Am Malala* - Malala Yousafzai
- [x] *Steve Jobs* - Walter Isaacson
- [x] *When Breath Becomes Air* - Paul Kalanithi
	- A short but very meaningful read. "As a resident, my highest ideal was not saving lives—everyone dies eventually—but guiding a patient or family to an understanding of death or illness."

### Science, Math, and Philosophy
- *Meditations* - Marcus Aurelius
- *Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid* - Douglas R. Hofstadter
- *Sapiens* - Yuval Noah Harari
- *The Stranger* - Albert Camus
- *A Short History of Nearly Everything* - Bill Bryson
- *A Brief History of Time* – Stephen Hawking
- *How to Change Your Mind* - Michael Pollan
- *General Relativity* - Leonard Susskind
- *How to Avoid a Climate Disaster* - Bill Gates
- *Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams* - Matthew Walker
- *Walden* - Henry David Thoreau
- [x] *21 Lessons for the 21st Century* - Yuval Noah Harari
- [x] *Permanent Record* - Edward Snowden
	- I recommend this to basically everybody. Highlights the massive danger companies and governments create by disrespecting people's privacy. Reminded me to pursue a responsible career in tech.

### Self-Help
#### Finance/Career
- *The Millionaire Next Door* - Thomas J. Stanley, William D. Danko
- *The Intelligent Investor* - Benjamin Graham
- *The 4-Hour Workweek* - Timothy Ferriss
- *80,000 Hours: Find a fulfilling career that does good* - Benjamin Todd
- [x] *The Richest Man in Babylon* - George Clason
	- Often described as timeless advice, this book gives financial principles to live by (guard your hard-earned money, put money to work for you). Most of the advice seems applicable today, but some feels a bit archaic.
- [x] *I Will Teach You to Be Rich* - Ramit Sethi
	- Much more modern and timely advice: Get the big things right and don't stress so much about the small ones. I enjoy his focus on the idea of a "rich life"—one where you can "spend lavishly on things you really enjoy, but cut back mercilessly on other things."

#### Other
- *The Power of Habit* - Charles Duhigg
- *Like a Virgin* - Richard Branson
- *Range* - David Epstein
- [x] *Atomic Habits* - James Clear
	- Overall good book. Forcing yourself to build/break habits is like swimming upstream. This book focuses on techniques that are more pleasant and effective. I still successfully use some of the principles from this book (tracked cycling progress encouraged me to go out more, keeping a water bottle with me made drinking more water effortless).
- [x] *Spark Joy* - Marie Kondo
- [x] *The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up* - Marie Kondo
	- This book was more of a guide to tidying—folding clothes, packing bags, etc. Both books were a good reminder to be intentional about the things I do/keep.

### Cookbooks
- *Flour Water Salt Yeast* - Ken Forkish
- *The Wok* - J. Kenji Lopez-Alt
	- Amazing cookbook that answers the *why* of cooking more so than the *how*. I've used his principles to make excellent stir-fried noodles and tofu.
- *The Food Lab* - J. Kenji Lopez-Alt
- *Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat* - Samin Nosrat
- *On Food and Cooking* - Harold McGee

### Fiction
- *Foundation* - Isaac Asimov
- *I, Robot* - Isaac Asimov
- *Stranger in a Strange Land* - Robert Heinlein
- *Slaughterhouse Five* - Kurt Vonnegut
- *Cat's Cradle* - Kurt Vonnegut
- *The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas* - Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis
- *1984* - George Orwell
- *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* - Douglas Adams (DNF)
- *The Count of Monte Cristo* - Alexandre Dumas
	- Finished it a long time ago, DNFed while re-reading recently.
- *The Kite Runner* - Khaled Hosseini
- *Exhalation* – Ted Chiang
- *Don Quixote* - Miguel De Cervantes Saavedra
- [x] *Stories of Your Life and Others* - Ted Chiang
- [x] *A Thousand Splendid Suns* - Khaled Hosseini
	- Beautifully written story with complex characters. Also one of my favorite books of all time.
- [x] *The Martian* - Andy Weir
- [x] *Project Hail Mary* - Andy Weir
	- One of the best books I've read - just as good as—if not better than—*The Martian*. Amazing characters and scientific detail, just like his first novel.
- [x] *Norwegian Wood* - Haruki Murakami
	- I enjoyed how artfully Murakami sets mundane scenes, but some poorly developed characters really broke the book for me.
- [x] *Siddhartha* - Hermann Hesse
