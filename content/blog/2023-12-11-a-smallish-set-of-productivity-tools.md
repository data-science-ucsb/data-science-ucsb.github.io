I'm siding with the photographers and dermatologists on this one. The best camera is the one you use. The best sunscreen is the one you use. The best productivity tools are the ones you *actually* use. **Over-optimizing your workflow is largely a waste of time.**

That said, configuring new apps is a little hobby of mineâ€”they're like toys! I've also spent my fair share of time consuming productivity content by [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/@aliabdaal) and [Matt D'Avella](https://www.youtube.com/@mattdavella/). They're [fun](https://nesslabs.com/productivity-porn) to watch! But they haven't really changed my life.

What *has* had real impact? Sticking to (mostly) simple, battle-tested tools over long periods of time.

That said, here's yet another list of productivity apps on the internet:

**Obsidian** is my default writing app. I love that it's powerful but not complicated; the designers believe that ["software is ephemeral"](https://stephango.com/file-over-app), but files are long-lasting. I use its Daily Notes plugin to jot down random thoughts and ideas; each daily note also has a to-do list, which rolls over unfinished tasks from the previous day.

**Standard Notes** is a neat but (very) simple tool. I'm not always at my computer to use Obsidian, so if I have an sudden idea or need to write something quickly, I use the mobile app. I also use it for things like grocery shopping.

**GoodNotes** is what I use for note-taking on my iPad. I typically use it as a scratchpad, but I also project GoodNotes when teaching Data Science Club workshops. I also use it to annotate machine learning papers. To sync annotated papers with my laptop, I use a file server on my [homelab](/blog/in-praise-of-the-homelab).

**Apple Calendar** is quite vanilla, but I have it sync to a [Radicale](https://radicale.org/master.html) server to give me full control over my data. I have separate calendars for classes, extracurricular activities, and other activities (such as climbing). If I need to do something at a specific time, I put it on my calendar by default.

**ChatGPT** almost goes without saying. I've been playing with LLMs on my laptop, but GPT-4 is state-of-the-art. I mostly just use it as a glorified search engine, but I also ask it to write simple scripts and act as a debugging assistant. One of the biggest advantages is ChatGPT's ability to answer questions by writing codeâ€”which is Daniel Kahneman's idea of System 2 Thinking.

**iTerm2, Vim, and VSCodium** are the developer tools I use most often. I spend most of my development time in the terminal, but I open VSCodium when I need to work with Jupyter notebooks. I only use VSCode occasionally to utilize GitHub Copilot.

**Homebrew, Hammerspoon, SKHD, and Yabai** are MacOS automation tools. Homebrew is my package manager, which installs and updates all applications on my computer. With Hammerspoon, I can write scripts in Lua that directly open any app with a hotkey. SKHD and Yabai, meanwhile, help me split and resize windows with just a few keypresses. Together, these tools help me avoid constantly reaching for the trackpadâ€”which seems unnecessary but has helped me context-switch between applications effortlessly.
