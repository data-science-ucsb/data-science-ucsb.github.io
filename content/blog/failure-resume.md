Success isn't linear. Most progress is one step back, two steps forward. I've
had a lot of [achievements](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanayb11/) over the
past few years, but this isn't the place for that.

This is my anti-LinkedIn page; it's the salt in a good cookie. It makes my
successes sweeter, but it more importantly paints a realistic picture of
the things I've done. It reminds me of what I've learned from failure,
acknowledges that I've worked hard for the things I care about, and motivates
me to keep doing so.

Like the [antilibrary](/blog/antilibrary), I copied this excellent idea from [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/a-failure-resume).

### 2023
- Rejected (placed low on waitlist) by [ERSP](https://ersp.cs.ucsb.edu/)
	- Ended up finding a ML research lab and contributing to a RL project anyway, so the above wasn't that big of a deal.
- Rejected from an undergrad TA position in the CS department (again)
    - Accepted the 3rd time around for Fall 2023! It's been great
- Gave up on joining a UCSB quantum computing lab and an NLP lab
	- Strategically giving up is not easy. I lost interest in theoretical quantum computing (a la error-correction algorithms) and didn't see a good fit in that NLP lab. In this case, the strategy worked well.

### 2022
- Rejected by 96 of 96 internship positions I applied to
- Rejected from MIT (and all my other top-choice universities)
	- This was particularly disappointing because [SSP](https://summerscience.org/) (a research program I attended) has abnormally high rates (~20-30%) of alumni who attend there. Learned that hard work doesn't guarantee you'll achieve a specific goal; many things are simply outside your control.
- Rejected from the [Atlas Fellowship](https://www.atlasfellowship.org/)
- Rejected from an undergrad TA position in the CS department
