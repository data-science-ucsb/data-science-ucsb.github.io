struggled for a little while with Bayes' Theorem. I could use the formulas, but I didn't grok the concept.\nThere are two popular camps in probability: the Frequentist camp and the Bayesian camp. Let's say we're interested in the probability that it rains tomorrow in San Francisco (let's say $p = 0.35$).\n\nThe Frequentists see that probability and think, \"If we simulated tomorrow a lot of times (approaching an infinite number of times), then 35% of those simulations will have rain.\"\nThe Bayesians, on the other hand think, \"We're 35% confident that it'll rain tomorrow.\" They see probabilities as confidence scores on a scale from 0 to 1.\n\nThe Bayesian view is often convenient: if you're a frequentist, it doesn't really make immediate sense to say, \"There's a 3% chance that nuclear war breaks out in the next 10 years.\" We aren't looking into 1000 alternative 10-year timelines and saying \"Nuclear war breaks out in 30 of them.\" No. We're saying that we're 3% confident that nuclear war will happen in our 10-year timeline.\nBayes' Theorem\nA Bayesian view of probability also allows us to update our beliefs (confidence scores) when given new information. The classic example is the medical diagnosis: Say we know that COVID-19 occurs in 8% of the general population, the test identifies 99% of people who actually have COVID, and any random person tests positive with 10% probability.\nIf we take any random person, we're 8% confident that they have COVID. But if we're given that they test positive, we can use Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs.\n\nThe number 8% is our prior probability (belief) that the person has COVID\nWe can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the person has COVID. This is the probability after we've factored in the given information (that they tested positive).\n\nWe want to find the probability $P(C|+)$, the probability the person has COVID ($C$) given that they've tested positive ($+$). Using the definition of conditional probability,\n$$\nP(C|+) = \\frac{P(C \\text{ and } +)}{P(+)} \\tag{1}\n$$\n$$\nP(+|C) = \\frac{P(C \\text{ and } +)}{P(C)} \\implies\nP(C \\text{ and } +) = P(+|C)P(C)\n\\tag{2}\n$$\nThen, when we substitute the final result from $(2)$ into $(1)$, we see that\n$$\nP(C|+) = \\frac{P(+|C)P(C)}{P(+)} \\tag{3}\n$$\nThis is Bayes' Theorem! If we plug in our numbers, then we get that:\n$$\nP(C|+) = \\frac{0.99 \\cdot 0.08}{0.10} = 0.792\n$$\nThe end result is counterintuitive—if someone told you the test has a 99% true positive rate (meaning that it correctly identifies 99% of people with COVID), then you might be pretty worried. There's a high chance the person has COVID, given they tested positive, but it's not as straightforward as it might seem because COVID isn't that common in the general population.\nInterpreting Bayes' Theorem, Qualitatively\nIt's possible to apply the idea of Bayes' Theorem to everyday life as well! Even without actual numbers, we can see how the formula behaves when certain values are small/large:\nIf a reliable news source (you are very confident they will publish any truthful story) releases an article about an extremely unlikely event (aliens landing on the surface of Earth), then it makes sense to be skeptical.\n$$\nP(\\text{truthful} | \\text{published}) = \\frac{P(\\text{published} | \\text{truthful})P(\\text{truthful})}{P(\\text{published})}\n$$\nLet's break this down again:\n\n$P(\\text{truthful} | \\text{published})$ is what we're interested in: it's our posterior. We can use this to represent our trust (higher posterior probability means higher trust).\nMaybe you're confident they will publish any truthful story they come across, so $P(\\text{published} | \\text{truthful})$ is high. This is called the likelihood. More on this in a second.\nAliens landing on Earth is very improbable (given our current beliefs), so $P(\\text{truthful})$ is low. This is the prior.\n\nSince aliens are unlikely to land on Earth (the prior is low), then our posterior will also be lower because of this.\n\n\n$P(\\text{published})$ is the probability any story is published by the source. This is called the marginal.\n\nIf they don't publish a lot of stories, then our trust (posterior belief) increases. If they publish a lot of stories, then our trust won't be as high. 1\n\n\nLet's consider how the marginal and likelihood together affect the posterior:\n\nIf the news outlet publishes a lot of the true stories that are out there, but it doesn't publish a lot of stories in general, then our posterior belief will be quite high.\nIf the news outlet doesn't publish a lot of the truthful stories that are out there, and if the outlet does publish a lot of stories, then we shouldn't have much confidence that aliens have actually landed.\n\n\n\nI originally intended for this post to be brief, but it's become more of a rant than I expected. But if we're trying to make more informed and rational decisions when given new information, perhaps Bayes' Theorem is a useful tool.\n\n1\nThis is kind of like inflation - publishing a lot of articles decreases the trustworthiness/value of a new article.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/a-bit-about-bayes-theorem/","title":"A bit about Bayes' Theorem"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/a-smallish-set-of-productivity-tools/":{"body":"I'm siding with the photographers and dermatologists on this one.

Sticking to (mostly) simple, battle-tested tools over long periods of time.\nThat said, here's yet another list of productivity apps on the internet:\nObsidian is my default writing app. I love that it's powerful but not complicated; the designers believe that \"software is ephemeral\", but files are long-lasting. I use its Daily Notes plugin to jot down random thoughts and ideas; each daily note also has a to-do list, which rolls over unfinished tasks from the previous day.\nStandard Notes is a neat but (very) simple tool. I'm not always at my computer to use Obsidian, so if I have an sudden idea or need to write something quickly, I use the mobile app. I also use it for things like grocery shopping.\nGoodNotes is what I use for note-taking on my iPad. I typically use it as a scratchpad, but I also project GoodNotes when teaching Data Science Club workshops. I also use it to annotate machine learning papers. To sync annotated papers with my laptop, I use a file server on my homelab.\nApple Calendar is quite vanilla, but I have it sync to a Radicale server to give me full control over my data. I have separate calendars for classes, extracurricular activities, and other activities (such as climbing). If I need to do something at a specific time, I put it on my calendar by default.\nChatGPT almost goes without saying. I've been playing with LLMs on my laptop, but GPT-4 is state-of-the-art. I mostly just use it as a glorified search engine, but I also ask it to write simple scripts and act as a debugging assistant. One of the biggest advantages is ChatGPT's ability to answer questions by writing code—which is Daniel Kahneman's idea of System 2 Thinking.\niTerm2, Vim, and VSCodium are the developer tools I use most often. I spend most of my development time in the terminal, but I open VSCodium when I need to work with Jupyter notebooks. I only use VSCode occasionally to utilize GitHub Copilot.\nHomebrew, Hammerspoon, SKHD, and Yabai are MacOS automation tools. Homebrew is my package manager, which installs and updates all applications on my computer. With Hammerspoon, I can write scripts in Lua that directly open any app with a hotkey. SKHD and Yabai, meanwhile, help me split and resize windows with just a few keypresses. Together, these tools help me avoid constantly reaching for the trackpad—which seems unnecessary but has helped me context-switch between applications effortlessly.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/a-smallish-set-of-productivity-tools/","title":"A small(ish) set of productivity tools that I use"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/antilibrary/":{"body":"Welcome to my digital collection of books: read, being-read, and to-be-read!\n\nWhat is an antilibrary?\nInstead of a celebration of everything you know, an antilibrary is an ode\nto everything you want to explore.\n\nI got the idea from Jacky Zhao.\nBiographical/Memoir\n\nElon Musk - Walter Isaacson\nBad Blood - John Carreyrou\nThe Diary of a Young Girl - Anne Frank\nMan's Search for Meaning - Viktor E.

Now, what on earth should I do?\"\nThe description of this article was somewhat a lie: In reality, both execution\nand ideation are extremely hard (or are they?). So many of us—including me—have\ndecided to start a project out of the blue, spending hours considering possible\nproblems to solve and whether or not an adequate solution already exists. The\nproject, naturally, ends in frustration and with nothing to show in the end.\nWhen starting on a project, the most important element is an organic idea.\nRegardless of how genius or foolish the idea is, I have found that the most\nenjoyable, interesting, and impressive projects stem from organic ideas.\n\"Great, so what exactly is an organic idea?\"\nThe best ideas are ones that come \"out of the blue,\" that is, ideas that are not\nforced by a brainstorming session or hours of sitting in front of an empty\ndocument and whiteboard. According to Barbara Oakley, an engineering professor at\nOakland University and a meta-learning educator, when the brain is not focused\nintently on a particular task, it \"enters into a natural default mode of diffuse\nthinking\" 1. In this state, the brain is free to generate new ideas by\nconnecting previously acquired knowledge and observations.\nMost of us are already familiar with this state: we know that studying a unit's\nmaterial the night before an exam is not conducive to scoring well, and we also\nknow that being repeatedly exposed to information—say, words in a foreign\nlanguage—is an excellent way to learn. In fact, jadeocr\nleverages a similar effect.\nJadeocr illustrates the importance of organic thinking in two ways: The app\nencourages the mind to naturally develop a vocabulary base through the\naforementioned spaced-repetition,\ntechnique, allowing users to slowly acquire foreign language vocabulary\nwhile giving enough time between review sessions to allow the brain to engage\nits diffuse mode. Additionally, jadeocr itself was a product of organic thinking.\nThe idea for jadeocr came to me during my fourth-period Mandarin class in my\nsophomore year—notably, it was not the result of any brainstorming session.\nI was simply sitting at my desk, practicing writing a handful of simplified\ncharacters to prepare for a coming vocabulary quiz. I wasn't worried about scoring\nwell on that particular quiz, but I wanted to earn a perfect score on\nthe upcoming midterm exam, and the only thing holding me back was a few writing\nmistakes.\nAs an aside, writing Chinese characters requires some attention to\ndetail; some notorious examples are 末/未, 复/夏, 换/挽, 口/囗. The last one,\nto be fair, has a radical,\nbut my point still stands.\nAs I started to search for apps that could help me prepare for the next midterm\nexam, I realized that each of them had some shortcomings that I was not willing\nto deal with. Eventually, I came to terms with the fact that no existing app\nsatisfied my needs, so I set out on building my own with some help from a friend.\nThe idea was organic, and as a result I was genuinely passionate about the project:\nI didn't mind working on it for eight or more hours per day during my summer\nbreak, and the result of my work was a product that I was proud of. Moreover,\nI was willing to build it again—nearly\nfrom scratch—to improve my code quality, add more features, and share it with\nmore people.\nWe all generate ideas this way: We all have those points where we think, \"if\nthis existed, my life would be so much easier.\" The two most difficult parts of\nbringing these ideas to fruition are capturing the idea and getting started. \nCapturing ideas—taking note of them when they occur—consists of two primary\nsteps: Recognizing the idea and capturing it. Recognizing ideas takes practice;\nthe next time an idea comes to mind—the next time you wish \"I wish this existed\"\nor the next time you think \"it would be cool if this was a thing\"—make a mental\nnote of that idea. Thoughts are ephemeral, however, so an even better idea is\nto make either a physical or digital note.\nWith ideas in hand, the hardest step is now getting started. Everything else\nwill fall into place after a project has started: Specifications, technologies,\nand design can all more or less figure themselves out without too much effort.\nThis doesn't mean building a project doesn't require significant amounts of\ntime and effort—it does. However, with an organic idea, the passion required\nto drive a project forward is often self-sustaining.\n\n1\nA Mind for Numbers.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/capitalizing-on-ideas/","title":"Capitalizing on ideas"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/deploying-a-full-stack-application/":{"body":"Between lines of code and a website lies the world of\nDevOps: \"Development Operations.\"\nArguably, DevOps is the most overlooked—and challenging—parts of the software\ndevelopment lifecycle. Nevertheless, it is still an equally crucial process, and\nit involves everything from version control to build to deployment and scaling.\nThe DevOps cycle is not separate from the code: It is a part of the code.\nFor jadeocr, we used Git for our version control\nsystem and GitHub as our remote repository and\nproject management hub. The platform is where we keep track of issues and manage\ncollaborating on code. We also use GitHub as part of our\nCI/CD pipeline\nto automatically build the website and server and make the changes live on the\nwebsite.\nPushing code to the master branch of our GitHub repository triggers numerous\nGitHub workflows that comprise our CI/CD process. GitHub first sends a ping\nacross the web—an HTTP POST\nrequest—to our server. After receiving the request from GitHub, a continuous deployment\nserver written in Node.js—previously in Golang—quickly goes to work, pulling\nthe latest code from the GitHub master branch and uses\nDocker Compose to build and start the\napplication containers,\nwhich are isolated environments called in which application code can run. The\nserver simply executes a series of shell commands after it receives a request\nat a particular API endpoint; from a\ntechnical perspective, therefore, this system is quite simple.\nAfterward, a GitHub action builds the jadeocr-next client and the server into\ntheir respective Docker images and publishes them to the\nGitHub Container Registry.\nThese containers solve the common issue of \"it works on my machine\" and make\nbuilding, deploying, and scaling applications with\nKubernetes relatively straightforward\n1. Although I faced several (frustrating) hurdles while writing the\ninitial configuration files for these Docker containers, managing them after\nthe initial setup process has been a breeze.\nPerhaps the most complex individual cog in this software\ndevelopment machine is Nginx (Engine-X)\nserver and reverse proxy. Nginx is simply a web server, but it can also function\nas a reverse proxy\nto direct web traffic to its intended destination. We use Nginx in two places:\nin front of the website's static files and in front of the entire website.\nWhen we build the website files into the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that the\nbrowser renders after loading jadeocr-next, our web\nframework's build tool, Vue CLI, creates a directory\nof static files that must be served by a web server. Therefore, we use Nginx in\nfront of the client to serve these static files. We then use another Nginx\nserver in our cloud virtual machine to direct API requests to our web server\nand website requests to the aforementioned client Nginx server. \nAlthough each system is fairly simple on its own, the confluence of all these\ntools in a single pipeline creates many moving parts which are challenging—but\nfun—to manage. Perhaps such a DevOps system is overkill for such a small\napplication, but it provides jadeocr-next with the ability to easily scale and\navoid future errors. Most importantly, however, going through this DevOps\njourney has been a valuable and fulfilling experience for me—even if I do\nsometimes spend multiple days staring at a terminal window in confusion.\n:wq\n\n1\nFor now, we are running jadeocr-next on a virtual private server (VPS),\nbut we do plan to deploy a Kubernetes cluster in the future.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/deploying-a-full-stack-application/","title":"Deploying a full-stack web application"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/failure-resume/":{"body":"Success isn't linear.

It's intended to be a starting point for learning more about embeddings and how NLP works!\nThe target audience for this workshop was students with some background in ML and a good familiarity with probability and linear algebra.\nEmbeddings\nSay we have a set of all words (or parts of words) our model knows, called a vocabulary:\n$$\nV = \\{ \\text{I}, \\text{am}, \\text{a}, \\text{set}, \\text{and}, \\text{have}, \\text{only}, \\text{twelve}, \\text{words}, \\text{in}, \\text{my}, \\text{vocabulary} \\}\n$$\nMotivation: How do we represent words/phrases/sentences/etc. in computer-friendly format (i.e. numbers)? Convert it into a vector space!\nOne Hot Encoding\nIf the size of our vocabulary is $|V|$, then we can represent each word as a $|V|$-dimensional vector with a 1 in one location and a 0 everywhere else. This is the one-\"hot\" approach.\n$$\n\\vec{v_\\text{twelve}} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\n\\end{bmatrix}^T\n$$\nAlthough it converts words/sentences into a computer friendly format, there are at least two big issues. Can you guess what they are?\n\nLarge vocabularies will result in unnecessarily massive and sparse vectors\nBecause the vectors are so sparse, we don't get any inherent notion of semantics or relationships between words (all words are orthogonal to each other in the vector space)\n\nSo the one-hot approach is bad. Let's try something else!\nTF-IDF\nStands for \"Term Frequency, Inverse Document Frequency.\" This approach gives us an idea of how important a word is in any document, using a numerical weight.\nTerm frequency is calculated by finding the proportion of times the term (word/token) shows up in the document. If $t$ is the term, $d$ is the document, and $f$ is the frequency, then we calculate it with:\n$$\n\\text{tf}(t, d) = \\frac{f_{t, d}}{\\sum_{t^\\prime \\in d} f_{t^\\prime, d}}\n$$\nInverse document frequency is calculated by dividing the total number of documents by the number of documents that contain the term $t$. We throw a logarithm in there, too. Here, $N$ is the number of documents and $D$ is the set of all documents. We add a $1$ on the numerator and denominator to avoid dividing by zero.\n$$\n\\text{idf}(t, d) = \\log \\frac{N + 1}{|\\{ d \\in D \\vert t \\in d \\}| + 1}$$\nWe can then multiply the two values together to get a single TF-IDF score:\n$$\n\\text{tf-idf}(t, d, D) = \\text{tf}(t, d) \\cdot \\text{idf}(t, d)\n$$\nWe can find how \"important\" certain words are in any given document by seeing how high their TF-IDF scores are. Intuitively, a high TF-IDF score means that a word shows up in few documents, but in a particular document $d$ it shows up frequently. Thus, it is likely to carry important information.\nWords like a, an, the are likely to be filtered out because they are likely to show up within many documents (even though they may show up often inside these documents). 2\nCreating Vectors: How do we create a vector from this information? For each term, we can just create a $|D|$-dimensional vector, where the $d$th index is the TF-IDF score $\\text{tf-idf}(t, d, D)$ for the word $t$ in document $d$.\nTF-IDF only does an OK job at capturing the semantic meanings and relationships between words. With a lot of documents, even the TF-IDF vectors can be sparse. However, this approach does better than one hot encoding, and it also captures how important each word is! Luckily, we can do better.\nWord2Vec (CBOW &amp; Skip-Gram)\nOf course, people have thought of using neural networks to solve the embeddings problem. Word2Vec is a family of models that use does exactly this.\nWord2Vec is an unsupervised classification algorithm. We want to find the probabilities of other surrounding words in the vocabulary. (Therefore, we use a softmax activation in the final layer and cross-entropy loss while training.)\nOur goal is to perform Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We're training our Word2Vec model on a corpus of data. We want to choose our neural network's parameters such that the model maximizes the probability of related words showing up together.\nLet's clarify what that means. There are two approaches, CBOW and Skip-Gram.\n\n(The below is also taken from Boykis's Embeddings book)\n(Semantle is a fun Wordle spin-off based on Word2Vec)\n\nContinuous Bag of Words (CBOW)\nWe have a context window of fixed size, and we want to find the probabilities of the word in the blank.\nWe can use a simple MLP-style architecture (a fully connected layer with a linear classifier on top), and we can just grab the vectors from the hidden layer. We \"create one-hot encodings of each word to a numerical position, and each position back to a word, so that we can easily reference both our words and vectors. The goal is to be able to map back and forth when we do lookups and retrieval.\" (Boykis)\nSkip-Gram\nIn skip-gram, we predict all the words surrounding our input within the context window.\nWe assume that words that show up together have similar meanings (distributional hypothesis). Our goal is to push these similar words (vectors) closer together in the vector space.\nIn our skip-gram implementation, we use a one-hot encoding as the input to our neural network 3.\nIf you're interested in learning more, read about negative sampling, which helps train more efficiently on larger vocabularies.\nLinear Algebra, A Detour\nCurse of Dimensionality, Reduction via PCA\nWhen we have high-dimensional vectors in machine learning, we often want to reduce their dimensionality while still preserving as much important information as we can.\n\nOnce we start generating a large number of features (columns), we start\nrunning into the curse of dimensionality....\nThe more features we accumulate, the more data we need in order to accurately statistically confidently say anything about them, which results in models that may not accurately represent our data\n(Boykis)\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis\nYou might want to review What is an eigenvalue/eigenvector? (3Blue1Brown)\n\nSort eigenvectors of covariance matrix by eigenvalue (large $\\rightarrow$ small)\nPick top $k$ eigenvectors as principal components\nProject vectors onto principal components\n\nThe idea here is that we're translating our data into a new basis determined by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. By doing so, we pick the directions that best capture the variance in the data.\nIn-depth notes for the curious:\nThe covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ is a special type of matrix called a Hermitian matrix—meaning it's equal to its own (conjugate) transpose. In other words, $\\text{cov}(X, Y) = \\text{cov}(Y, X)$\nA property of such matrices is that the eigenvectors form a basis for their domain/range. Thus we can write any vector in the domain of the covariance matrix as a linear combination of the eigenvectors. The eigenvectors will also be orthogonal because the covariance matrix is Hermitian.\nWhen we perform PCA, we are changing the basis of our data into a new basis defined by the eigenvectors of $\\Sigma$.\n\nWhat’s&nbsp;special about this basis is it redefines your components to have zero linear dependence (in the variance of your data). That is, each eigenvector controls one and only one dimension of linear randomness. And the amount of randomness is given by your eigenvalue, which is the variance along that axis.\n- Daniel Naylor\n\nEmbedding Similarity Metrics\nSince we've embed our natural language into a vector space, we can now perform all sorts of vector math on them!\nOne of the most useful things to do is compute distances between various embeddings (which represent words/sentences/etc.).\nThere are all sorts of metrics between a pair of two-vectors $\\vec{x}, \\vec{y}$:\n\nManhattan Distance (L1): $\\text{dist}(\\vec{x}, \\vec{y}) = |x_1 - y_1| + |x_2 - y_2|$\nEuclidean Distance (L2): $\\text{dist}(\\vec{x}, \\vec{y}) = ((x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2)^\\frac{1}{2}$\nCosine Similarity: $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{y}}{||\\vec{x}||||\\vec{y}||}$\n\nWe like to use cosine similarity in NLP to compare embeddings, because our vectors might be high-dimensional and have high Euclidean distances from each other. It's useful to call two vectors similar when they are close to parallel with each other.\nNOTE: Cosine similarity is not a true distance metric (violates the triangle inequality), but it's still a useful metric.\nVector Databases: The Power of Embeddings\nSemantic search allows you to search for content based on its meaning, rather than just matching keywords or doing a regular-expression search.\n\nExample Project (shameless self-promotion)\n\nLanguage Models &amp; Conditional Probability\n\nThis section adapted from Harvard CS197 Lecture Notes\n\nLanguage models are just models that estimate a probability distribution of words, conditioned on a sequence of previous words (technically, tokens, which can be words but also other things like contractions or punctuation).\nIn this very simple example, our model outputs these probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{sleep} | \\text{I'm really tired, I'm going to}) = 0.8$$\n$$P(\\text{study} | \\text{I'm really tired, I'm going to}) = 0.2$$\nWe have a similar process for sequence-to-sequence generation. If we pick the most likely word from above:\n$$P(\\text{soon} | \\text{I'm really tired, I'm going to sleep}) = 0.75$$\n$$P(\\text{today} | \\text{I'm really tired, I'm going to sleep}) = 0.1$$\n$$P(\\text{tonight} | \\text{I'm really tired, I'm going to sleep}) = 0.15$$\nSo then by simple probability rules,\n$$\nP(\\text{I'm really tired, I'm going to sleep soon} | \\text{I'm really tired, I'm going to}) = 0.8 \\times 0.75 = 0.6\n$$\nThis is the end of the notes for what I covered in the workshop—the next workshop is planned to be an introduction to transformers and fine-tuning a model with HuggingFace!\n\n1\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/what_are_embeddings/main/embeddings.pdf) \n\n2\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\n\n3\nhttps://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/intro-to-nlp-embeddings/","title":"Intro to NLP (notes on embeddings)"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/notes-on-zoom-in-circuits/":{"body":"Introduction\nThere's an uncanny overlap between the Effective Altruism and machine learning communities. Even more so in mechanistic interpretability, the subfield of ML that focuses on reverse-engineering and understanding the weights inside neural networks.\nI don't consider myself to have gone that deep in to the EA realm, but I've read a few posts on 80,000 Hours, LessWrong. Some people invested in EA have started programs such as MAIA, STS 10SI, and ARENA. I read some of these pages and Neel Nanda's blog, which led me to reimplement GPT-2 and explore more of the field.\nOne of the \"foundational\" papers is \"Zoom In: An Introduction to Circuits\" by Olah et. al. on Distill.pub. Below are some of my comments and notes on the paper. A lot of the content borrows directly from the source, so all figures and direct quotes are attributed to the paper and OpenAI Microscope.\nClaims 1-2: Neurons + circuits are understandable\nKey ideas:\n\nThe possible activations of a given layer form a vector space. Features are directions in that vector space.\nCircuits are subgraphs of the overall neural network's computational graph. We want to think of them like cells in an organism.\nBoth can be rigorously studied (quantitatively and qualitatively), and qualitative study is still important—even though most ML research focuses on maximizing quantitative benchmarks.\n\nCurve Detectors\n\nWe believe that neural networks consist of meaningful, understandable features. Early layers contain features like edge or curve detectors, while later layers have features like floppy ear detectors or wheel detectors. The community is divided on whether this is true.\n\n\n    \n    \n\nThe authors uncovered curve detection neurons and presented several arguments as to why they detected curves—and not anything else. Note that these curve detectors have an orientation as well: For instance, left-facing curves did not highly activate the right-facing curve detector's neurons.\n\nIf we try to maximize activations of these neurons, we produce curves\nThe training examples that maximized the activations contained curves\nArtificially drawn curves resulted in high activations for these neurons\nRotating the curves reduced the activation for one orientation's neuron, but another orientation's curve-detecting neuron started to fire\n\"We can read a curve detection algorithm off the weights\"\n\"The downstream clients of curve detectors are features that naturally involve curves\"\nWe can manually set weights to implement a curve detector\n\nYou can play with the activations for InceptionV1 and other models using OpenAI's Microscope.\nHigh-Low Frequency Detectors\nHowever, not all features the network learns are obvious: \n\n[Some neurons] look for low- frequency patterns on one side of their receptive field, and high-frequency patterns on the other side. Like curve detectors, high-low frequency detectors are found in families of features that look for the same thing in different orientations.\nThey seem to be one of several heuristics for detecting the boundaries of objects, especially when the background is out of focus.\n\n\n    \n    \n\nDog Detectors\nThe authors also found circuits for detecting for a left-facing dog and a right-facing dog. Those features are then combined to form orientation-invariant dog detectors. (Remember, circuits are just computational subgraphs in the neural network.)\nNote: In the below figure, blue arrows represent negative weights, while red arrows represent positive weights.  The below figure is copied directly from the Distill article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[The network] could easily create invariant neurons by not caring very much about where the eyes, fur and snout went, and just looking for a jumble of them together. But instead, the network has learned to carve apart the left and right cases and handle them separately.\n\nThe negative weights are inhibitors. Concretely: A neuron that implements a left-facing head detector looks at the fur orientation from the previous layer. If the fur is oriented left, then the activation for this left-facing head detector increases. If the fur is oriented right, then that activation is lower!\nPolysemanticity\nIt gets even weirder: Some circuits form a weird combination of \"human-understandable features.\" The authors label this phenomenon the \"polysemanticity of neurons.\" There's no reason a neural network has to \"learn\" in a human-like way; it's remarkable that curve detectors—and even dog detectors (as the paper goes on to discuss)—operate like this at all!\nEven more oddly, neural networks can and sometimes deliberately introduce polysemanticity. If a neuron reads a fur detector, paw detector, and a car detector as input, it may represent a feature that is some weird combination of fur, paw, and car—because of course it doesn't have to behave like a human! It's a pile of linear algebra1!\nThe authors hypothesize that this is done to effectively compress the network's representation of features. It has a finite \"representation space\" that is governed by its depth and the number of weights. Anthropic has an article on this phenomenon, called superposition.\nI came across a Twitter—I mean X—thread the other day that suggests neural networks are just compression. This paper (that I haven't yet read) also appears to suggest the same.\nThis is really annoying for interpretability. Is it possible to train models without inherent polysemanticity? Perhaps we can design some loss function that looks at each neuron and discourages polysemantic neurons from forming. But to do this, we need to quantify what makes a neuron polysemantic—something that hasn't been done yet (at least according to my knowledge).\nClaim 3: Similar circuits form across models\nDo neural networks in general learn in the same ways and develop similar circuits? Evidence suggests yes, but we don't have a good way of really supporting this hypothesis.\nIn this way, finding similar circuits across various models is analogous to finding similar traits across species to classify them. That brings us to interpretability as a natural science...\nThe State of Interpretability\nMaybe neural networks are too complicated, and it's unfeasible to mathematically understand everything that's going on at the top level. But the hope is that we can break things down into circuits—just as biologists broke down life into cells, and physicists broke up the world into atoms (and now subatomic particles).\n\nCircuits sidestep these challenges by focusing on tiny subgraphs of a neural network for which rigorous empirical investigation is tractable. They’re very much falsifiable: for example, if you understand a circuit, you should be able to predict what will change if you edit the weights.\n\nPerhaps \"I found this cool circuit\" doesn't get published into NeurIPS or ICML, but it's still important research. If we can find motifs, what the authors call circuit/feature patterns across models and tasks, we will still be able to form general hypotheses and theories about how machines learn.\nBecause interpretability is a young niche within machine learning, there's so much low-hanging fruit. And that excites me, because it's accessible! If we want a world with human-centered, safe AI, we need interpretability. And we need to ensure that research and development are not centered in the hands of a powerful, elite few. That's why interpretability excites me—and if I haven't convinced you, I hope you read the entire paper to convince yourself, too.\n\n2\nhttps://xkcd.com/1838/\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/notes-on-zoom-in-circuits/","title":"Notes on \"Zoom In - An Introduction to Circuits\""},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/now/":{"body":"This page is a working list of my short/medium-term projects + goals.\n\nSearching for Summer 2024 internships\nTaking classes in operating systems, deep learning, algorithms, scientific computing\nServing as a learning assistant for the discrete mathematics course\nWriting ML lectures/workshops for the UCSB Data Science Club\n\nCreating a brand-new AI safety reading group, starting in January 2024\n\nWe were met with a large amount of interest!\nSelf-studying mechanistic interpretability and transformers to prepare\n\n\n\n\nRecently joined a machine learning research lab, focused on robustness\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/now/","title":"/blog/now"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/reading-ai-research-papers-harvard-cs197/":{"body":"This is a part of my collection of \"Learn in Public\" notes.
